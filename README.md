This basic web application was my first personal project, which I developed at PennApps Hackathon Fall 2017. The page integrated the MailChimp API to allow for users to sign up. I sourced the poems from Pennâ€™s Kelly Writer House, my network, and poems that piqued my interest. 

I discontinued the service due to time constraints, but I am looking to return to it and add automated elements.
